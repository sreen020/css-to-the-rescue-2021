## Assignment
When we received this assignment I did not know in witch direction I would go. I did a little research about CSS Zen Garden. This is a website where everyone can style **the same** HTML. The outcome of each person is very different. 
<br>
I chose to work on the menu assignment. Like the CSS Zen Garden, the HTML is already made. My duty is to create the styling with as many new methods I could find.
<br>
## What do I want to use?
I often use the same css stuff. It works, so why try new ones right? Well in this assignment I learned a **LOT** of new css tricks.<br>

**Grid**<br>
Before this assignment I only used flexbox. I knew grid existed but I’ve never working with it. To get familiar with grid I used https://cssgridgarden.com/<br>
<br>
**Darkmode**<br>
Whaaaaaaat?? Is there a darkmode function in CSS?<br>
<br>
**Transform**<br>
I know I can rotate something with this!<br>
<br>
**Animate**<br>
When I see all those keyframes and percentages I’ll get scared.<br>
<br>
**Checkbox hack**<br>
How can you make working buttons using CSS only?<br>
<br>
**Print stylesheets**<br>
I’ve honestly never tough about this.<br>
